# Task ID: 29
# Title: Implement Positioning Canvas Generation Endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 23, 24, 25, 26, 28
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the /campaigns/positioning endpoint to generate positioning canvas with market timing and value propositions.
# Details:
1. Create FastAPI endpoint for /campaigns/positioning
2. Implement request validation using Pydantic
3. Create positioning canvas generation workflow:
   - Extract company positioning from website
   - Generate "why us / why now" summary
   - Create three unique value propositions
   - Tailor to ICP characteristics
4. Structure JSON response format
5. Add metadata for ICP source and confidence
6. Implement error handling for insufficient information
7. Add quality scoring for generated content
8. Create caching mechanism for repeated requests
9. Implement response streaming for long-running operations

# Test Strategy:
1. Test endpoint with various website inputs
2. Verify response structure matches schema
3. Test with both user-provided and inferred ICPs
4. Benchmark endpoint performance
5. Verify error handling for edge cases
6. Test streaming response functionality

# Subtasks:
## 1. API Endpoint Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement RESTful API endpoints following best practices, including versioning, naming conventions, and HTTP method usage.
### Details:
Endpoints should use descriptive resource names, plural nouns for collections, and include versioning in the URL or headers.

## 2. Request Validation Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Develop logic to validate incoming API requests for required parameters, data types, and schema compliance.
### Details:
Ensure all requests are checked for completeness and correctness before processing, returning appropriate error responses for invalid input.

## 3. Workflow Orchestration [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.2
### Description: Implement the core workflow logic that coordinates the sequence of operations and integrates with upstream services.
### Details:
Define the workflow steps, manage state transitions, and handle communication with external systems as needed.

## 4. Response Formatting [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.3
### Description: Format API responses in a consistent JSON structure, including data payloads and metadata.
### Details:
Ensure responses follow a standard schema, use camelCase or snake_case consistently, and include pagination metadata where applicable.

## 5. Metadata Inclusion [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.4
### Description: Add relevant metadata to API responses, such as pagination info, request IDs, and processing timestamps.
### Details:
Metadata should help clients interpret responses and debug issues, following best practices for clarity and completeness.

## 6. Error Handling and Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.4
### Description: Implement robust error handling with meaningful HTTP status codes and detailed error messages in a consistent format.
### Details:
Return error codes, messages, and context in the response body, ensuring consistency across all endpoints.

## 7. Quality Scoring Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.3
### Description: Develop and integrate a quality scoring mechanism to evaluate and score workflow outputs.
### Details:
Define scoring criteria, implement scoring algorithms, and include scores in the response payload.

## 8. Caching Strategy Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.3
### Description: Design and implement caching for API responses or workflow results to improve performance and reduce load on upstream services.
### Details:
Determine cache keys, expiration policies, and invalidation strategies appropriate for the data and workflow.

## 9. Streaming Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.3
### Description: Enable streaming of large or long-running responses to clients, ensuring efficient data delivery and resource management.
### Details:
Implement chunked transfer encoding or server-sent events as appropriate for the use case.
