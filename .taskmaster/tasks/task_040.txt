# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive monitoring and logging system for API performance and usage tracking.
# Details:
1. Implement structured logging with request/response tracking
2. Set up error monitoring and alerting
3. Create performance metrics collection
4. Implement API usage tracking
5. Add LLM service monitoring
6. Create dashboard for key metrics
7. Implement log rotation and retention
8. Add request tracing for debugging
9. Create health check endpoints
10. Implement status page for service availability

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify logs capture all necessary information
2. Test alerting for various error conditions
3. Validate metrics collection accuracy
4. Test health check endpoint functionality
5. Verify log rotation works correctly
6. Test request tracing for complex workflows

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Logging and Monitoring Objectives [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish clear objectives for structured logging, error monitoring, metrics collection, usage tracking, and LLM monitoring to ensure alignment with business and technical requirements.
### Details:
Identify key questions to answer with logs and metrics, such as error rates, usage patterns, and model performance.

## 2. Select and Integrate Structured Logging Library [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.1
### Description: Choose a structured logging library compatible with the tech stack and integrate it into the application.
### Details:
Ensure the library supports consistent formats (e.g., JSON), log levels, and context-rich entries as per best practices.

## 3. Implement Error Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.2
### Description: Set up error monitoring tools to capture, aggregate, and alert on application errors.
### Details:
Integrate with structured logs to provide context for errors and enable real-time alerting.

## 4. Set Up Metrics Collection [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.2
### Description: Instrument the application to collect key metrics such as latency, throughput, and resource usage.
### Details:
Use metrics libraries or APM tools to gather and store metrics for analysis.

## 5. Implement Usage Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.2
### Description: Track user interactions and feature usage to inform product decisions and monitor adoption.
### Details:
Ensure usage events are logged in a structured format and can be correlated with other telemetry.

## 6. Integrate LLM Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.2
### Description: Monitor large language model (LLM) usage, performance, and anomalies.
### Details:
Capture LLM input/output, latency, and error rates in structured logs and metrics.

## 7. Enable Request Tracing [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.2
### Description: Implement distributed tracing to track requests across services and correlate with logs and metrics.
### Details:
Integrate tracing IDs into structured logs for end-to-end visibility.

## 8. Configure Log Rotation and Retention [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.2
### Description: Set up log rotation policies to manage log file sizes and retention periods.
### Details:
Ensure compliance with data retention policies and prevent storage issues.

## 9. Implement Health Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.4
### Description: Develop health check endpoints and monitoring to ensure system components are operational.
### Details:
Integrate health check results into monitoring dashboards and alerting systems.

## 10. Create Dashboards and Status Page [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.3, 40.4, 40.5, 40.6, 40.7, 40.8, 40.9
### Description: Build dashboards for real-time and historical analysis of logs, metrics, and system health. Set up a public status page for transparency.
### Details:
Use observability tools to visualize data and communicate system status to stakeholders.
