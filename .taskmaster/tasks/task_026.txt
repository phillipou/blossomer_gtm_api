# Task ID: 26
# Title: Set Up LLM Service Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement service for LLM integration with multiple providers and fallback mechanisms.
# Details:
1. Create abstraction layer for LLM service providers
2. Integrate with OpenAI GPT-4 API as primary provider
3. Integrate with Anthropic Claude API as backup provider
4. Implement provider fallback mechanism
5. Create prompt template system using LangChain
6. Implement Pydantic output parsers for structured responses
7. Add retry logic for transient failures
8. Implement caching for common LLM requests
9. Create cost tracking and optimization
10. Add monitoring for LLM service health
11. Implement streaming response handling

# Test Strategy:
1. Test integration with each LLM provider
2. Verify fallback mechanism works correctly
3. Test prompt template rendering
4. Verify output parsing for various response types
5. Benchmark LLM request performance
6. Test streaming response functionality
7. Verify error handling for service outages

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Abstraction Layer Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and document the architecture for an abstraction layer that standardizes interactions with multiple LLM providers.
### Details:
Specify interfaces, data contracts, and extensibility points to ensure provider-agnostic integration.

## 2. Implement Provider Integrations [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Develop integration modules for each targeted LLM provider, adhering to the abstraction layerâ€™s interface.
### Details:
Utilize official SDKs or custom HTTP clients as needed for providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

## 3. Develop Fallback Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.2
### Description: Create logic to automatically switch between providers in case of failures or degraded performance.
### Details:
Implement provider prioritization, error handling, and retry mechanisms to ensure high availability.

## 4. Build Prompt Templating System [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Design and implement a flexible prompt templating system to standardize and customize prompts for different use cases and providers.
### Details:
Support variable interpolation, conditional logic, and provider-specific formatting.

## 5. Implement Output Parsing Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.2
### Description: Develop a module to parse and structure LLM outputs into standardized formats for downstream consumption.
### Details:
Handle JSON, text, and other structured outputs, including error and edge case handling.

## 6. Integrate Retry Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.3
### Description: Add robust retry logic for transient errors at both provider and network levels.
### Details:
Configure exponential backoff, maximum retry limits, and logging for retry attempts.

## 7. Implement Caching Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.5
### Description: Develop a caching mechanism to store and retrieve LLM responses for identical prompts to reduce cost and latency.
### Details:
Support configurable cache expiration and cache invalidation strategies.

## 8. Integrate Cost Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.2, 26.7
### Description: Build a system to track and report usage and costs per provider, prompt, and user.
### Details:
Aggregate API usage data and calculate costs based on provider pricing models.

## 9. Set Up Monitoring and Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.6, 26.8
### Description: Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging for all abstraction layer operations, including provider health, errors, and performance.
### Details:
Integrate with observability tools and set up alerts for anomalies or failures.

## 10. Enable Streaming Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.2, 26.4
### Description: Add support for streaming LLM responses where available, ensuring compatibility with the abstraction layer and provider modules.
### Details:
Handle partial outputs, stream termination, and client-side consumption of streamed data.

## 11. Conduct Complexity Analysis and Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 26.9, 26.10
### Description: Analyze architectural and operational complexity introduced by integrations, fallback, monitoring, and streaming; optimize for maintainability and scalability.
### Details:
Document bottlenecks, propose improvements, and ensure the system meets reliability and performance goals.
