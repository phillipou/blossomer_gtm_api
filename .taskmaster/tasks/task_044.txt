# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Evaluation Criteria [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish clear, measurable criteria for LLM quality evaluation, including both automated and human-assessed metrics such as correctness, relevancy, hallucination, and task completion.
### Details:
Criteria should cover general and task-specific aspects, ensuring comprehensive coverage of LLM capabilities and limitations.

## 2. Design LLM Scoring Methodology [pending]
### Dependencies: 44.1
### Description: Develop a scoring system that integrates both automated metrics (e.g., perplexity, ROUGE, BLEU) and human evaluation (e.g., direct assessment, comparative judgment).
### Details:
Ensure the methodology allows for both quantitative and qualitative assessment, capturing nuanced aspects of LLM outputs.

## 3. Create Benchmark Tasks and Datasets [pending]
### Dependencies: 44.1
### Description: Curate a diverse set of benchmark tasks and representative datasets to evaluate LLMs across a spectrum of scenarios and difficulty levels.
### Details:
Datasets should be unbiased and relevant to the intended use cases, supporting both automated and manual evaluation.

## 4. Conduct Comparative Evaluation [pending]
### Dependencies: 44.2, 44.3
### Description: Implement comparative evaluation processes, including pairwise model comparisons and relative ranking, to assess LLM performance against benchmarks and competitors.
### Details:
Utilize both automated metrics and human evaluators for robust comparison.

## 5. Collect User and Expert Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 44.4
### Description: Gather qualitative and quantitative feedback from users and domain experts on LLM outputs, focusing on strengths, weaknesses, and real-world applicability.
### Details:
Use surveys, rating scales, and open-ended feedback mechanisms to capture comprehensive insights.

## 6. Generate Improvement Suggestions [pending]
### Dependencies: 44.5
### Description: Analyze evaluation results and feedback to identify actionable suggestions for LLM improvement, targeting both model and evaluation process enhancements.
### Details:
Prioritize suggestions based on impact and feasibility.

## 7. Integrate Metadata for Evaluation Context [pending]
### Dependencies: 44.3, 44.4
### Description: Incorporate relevant metadata (e.g., task type, dataset source, evaluator identity) into the evaluation framework to enable detailed analysis and traceability.
### Details:
Ensure metadata is consistently captured and linked to evaluation results.

## 8. Develop Interactive Evaluation Dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: 44.4, 44.5, 44.7
### Description: Build a dashboard to visualize evaluation metrics, comparative results, feedback, and metadata, enabling stakeholders to explore and interpret LLM performance data.
### Details:
Dashboard should support filtering, drill-down, and export capabilities.

## 9. Perform Trend Analysis and Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 44.6, 44.8
### Description: Analyze longitudinal evaluation data to identify trends, performance shifts, and the impact of improvements over time.
### Details:
Generate regular reports and visualizations to inform ongoing LLM development and evaluation strategy.
