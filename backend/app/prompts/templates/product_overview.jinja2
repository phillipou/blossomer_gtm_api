## Quality Criteria for Your Response:
1. **Explicitness:** Prefer information directly stated on the website, but inference is allowed if clearly marked.
2. **Specificity:** All fields should be as specific and actionable as possible.
3. **Evidence-based:** Reference specific elements from the provided context.
4. **Actionable:** Output should be ready for use in sales/marketing planning.
5. **Realistic:** Avoid generic or aspirational statements.
6. **Comprehensive:** Cover all requested fields to provide a complete product intelligence overview.

## Important Notes:
- If context is insufficient for certain sections, return an empty string or empty list.
- Prioritize quality over completenessâ€”better to have fewer, high-confidence items than many weak ones.
- For testimonials, preserve exact wording and include attribution details when available.
- For alternatives, focus on direct competitors or clearly comparable solutions.
- Do NOT include any text outside the JSON structure.
- **Never refuse to answer. Always return a valid JSON object, even if most fields are empty or marked as inferred. If you cannot find enough information, do your best to infer or leave fields empty, but always return valid JSON.**
