- For current project tasks and status, see [.notes/TASKS.md](mdc:.notes/TASKS.md). Taskmaster is no longer used for project management.
- For detailed requirements, user stories, and technical specifications, see [.notes/PRD.md](mdc:.notes/PRD.md).
- For system architecture, service boundaries, and data flow, see [.notes/ARCHITECTURE.md](mdc:.notes/ARCHITECTURE.md).
- For all project-related documentation, meeting notes, architectural diagrams, and AI interaction logs, see the [.notes directory](mdc:.notes). This is the project knowledge base.
- For prompt system documentation and extension workflow, see [.notes/PROMPT_TEMPLATES.md](mdc:.notes/PROMPT_TEMPLATES.md).
- **All LLM prompts must be constructed using Jinja2 templates via the prompt registry.**
    - Do not use f-strings or string concatenation for prompts in production code.
    - Define prompt variables as Pydantic models in `prompts/models.py`.
    - Render prompts using `render_prompt(template_name, context_model)` from `prompts/registry.py`.
    - Place all prompt templates in `prompts/templates/`.
    - Handle context merging and formatting in the template, not in Python code.
- **Rationale:** Ensures maintainability, testability, and consistent context resolution across all endpoints and agents. Makes prompt changes easy and safe.
- **Example:**
    ```python
    from blossomer_gtm_api.prompts.registry import render_prompt
    from blossomer_gtm_api.prompts.models import MyPromptVars

    context = MyPromptVars(...)
    prompt = render_prompt("my_template", context)
    # Pass prompt to LLM
    ```
- **Enforcement:**
    - All new endpoints, agents, and prompt construction logic must follow this pattern.
    - Code reviews should reject direct string-based prompt construction for LLMs.
    - Refactor legacy endpoints to use this system as they are updated.

- **Required Rule Structure:**
  ```markdown
  ---
  description: Clear, one-line description of what the rule enforces
  globs: path/to/files/*.ext, other/path/**/*
  alwaysApply: boolean
  ---

  - **Main Points in Bold**
    - Sub-points with details
    - Examples and explanations
  ```

- **File References:**
  - Use `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` ([filename](mdc:filename)) to reference files
  - Example: [prisma.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/prisma.mdc) for rule references
  - Example: [schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma) for code references

- **Code Examples:**
  - Use language-specific code blocks
  ```typescript
  // ✅ DO: Show good examples
  const goodExample = true;
  
  // ❌ DON'T: Show anti-patterns
  const badExample = false;
  ```

- **Rule Content Guidelines:**
  - Start with high-level overview
  - Include specific, actionable requirements
  - Show examples of correct implementation
  - Reference existing code when possible
  - Keep rules DRY by referencing other rules

- **Rule Maintenance:**
  - Update rules when new patterns emerge
  - Add examples from actual codebase
  - Remove outdated patterns
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use bullet points for clarity
  - Keep descriptions concise
  - Include both DO and DON'T examples
  - Reference actual code over theoretical examples
  - Use consistent formatting across rules

# Mypy Best Practices and Coding Standards

- **Gradual Typing and Adoption**
  - Start with a manageable subset of the codebase; annotate new/modified code first.
  - Use `# type: ignore[error-code]` sparingly and always with a specific error code. Review these regularly.
  - Prioritize annotating widely imported modules for maximum benefit.

- **Consistent Configuration and Integration**
  - Use a version-controlled `mypy.ini` or `pyproject.toml` for config. Pin the mypy version in dependencies.
  - Integrate mypy into CI and optionally as a pre-commit hook.
  - Encourage use of mypy editor plugins for real-time feedback.

- **Leveraging Advanced Features**
  - Enable strict mode (`--strict`) and stricter flags as coverage improves.
  - Use `--warn-unused-ignores` to clean up unnecessary ignores.
  - Use advanced typing features: Protocols, TypedDict, generics, etc., for flexible and robust code.

- **Code Organization and Structure**
  - Organize code in a clear directory structure (e.g., `src/`).
  - Use consistent file/module naming and logical module boundaries.
  - Split large modules for readability and maintainability.

- **Common Patterns and Anti-patterns**
  - Prefer dependency injection and clear interfaces for testability.
  - Avoid excessive use of singletons, global state, and the `Any` type.
  - Catch specific exceptions, not generic ones.

- **Performance and Security**
  - Use efficient data structures and avoid unnecessary copying.
  - Use type hints to clarify and enforce input validation and security boundaries.

- **Testing Approaches**
  - Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Organize tests clearly.
  - Use mocking/stubbing in tests to isolate components.

- **Common Pitfalls and Gotchas**
  - Avoid inconsistent type annotations and circular dependencies.
  - Do not ignore mypy errors without good reason; they often indicate real issues.

- **Tooling and Environment**
  - Use a linter (e.g., flake8, ruff) and formatter (e.g., black, ruff) alongside mypy.
  - Integrate mypy into your CI/CD pipeline to catch type errors before deployment.

- **Additional Best Practices**
  - Use type hints for all function arguments and return values.
  - Use type aliases and the `typing` module for complex types.
  - Use `reveal_type()` for debugging type issues.
  - Keep code clean, well-organized, and follow PEP 8.
  - Use version control for all code and config changes.
