2. Verify tech stack detection quality
3. Test rate limiting compliance
4. Benchmark API performance
5. Verify error handling for API failures
6. Test provider fallback mechanism
7. Validate caching effectiveness

# Subtasks:
## 1. API Client Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a robust API client with best practices such as environment variable management, request organization, and secure handling of credentials.
### Details:
Implement folder structure for requests, use environment variables for different environments, and ensure sensitive data is encrypted and securely stored.

## 2. Company Lookup Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.1
### Description: Integrate with external APIs to perform company lookups based on provided identifiers (e.g., domain, name).
### Details:
Research and select appropriate company lookup APIs, understand their endpoints, and implement request/response handling.

## 3. Tech Stack Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.2
### Description: Retrieve and analyze the technology stack used by the target company using available APIs.
### Details:
Identify APIs that provide tech stack data, parse responses, and structure the data for downstream use.

## 4. Size and Revenue Estimation [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.2
### Description: Estimate company size and revenue using data enrichment APIs and available public datasets.
### Details:
Integrate with APIs that provide size and revenue estimates, and implement logic to handle missing or incomplete data.

## 5. Industry Classification [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.2
### Description: Classify the company into an industry category using external classification APIs or datasets.
### Details:
Map company data to industry codes (e.g., NAICS, SIC) and handle ambiguous or multi-industry cases.

## 6. Caching Layer Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.2, 34.3, 34.4, 34.5
### Description: Implement a caching mechanism to store and reuse API responses, reducing redundant requests and improving performance.
### Details:
Choose a caching strategy (in-memory, distributed), define cache keys, and set appropriate expiration policies.

## 7. Rate Limiting Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.1, 34.2, 34.3, 34.4, 34.5
### Description: Implement rate limiting logic to comply with external API usage policies and prevent throttling.
### Details:
Track API usage per provider, queue or delay requests as needed, and handle rate limit errors gracefully.

## 8. Error Handling and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.2, 34.3, 34.4, 34.5
### Description: Develop comprehensive error handling for all API interactions, including retries, fallbacks, and response validation.
### Details:
Standardize error formats, implement retry logic for transient errors, and validate API responses for completeness and correctness.

## 9. Provider Fallback Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement fallback mechanisms to switch between multiple data providers in case of failures or incomplete data.
### Details:
Define provider priority, implement health checks, and ensure seamless failover with minimal disruption.

## 10. End-to-End Integration Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.6, 34.7, 34.8, 34.9
### Description: Test the entire workflow, including all API integrations, caching, rate limiting, error handling, and fallback logic.
### Details:
Develop automated tests to simulate real-world scenarios, validate data enrichment, and ensure system robustness.
