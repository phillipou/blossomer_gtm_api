# Task ID: 37
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Error Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21, 23, 29, 30, 31, 32
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create robust error handling system with actionable error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes.
# Details:
1. Define custom exception classes for different error types
2. Create error response schema with consistent format
3. Implement global exception handler in FastAPI
4. Add detailed error messages with resolution guidance
5. Map exceptions to appropriate HTTP status codes
6. Implement logging for all errors
7. Add retry suggestions for transient errors
8. Create documentation links in error responses
9. Implement error tracking and monitoring

# Test Strategy:
1. Test error handling for various exception types
2. Verify HTTP status codes are appropriate
3. Test error message clarity and actionability
4. Verify logging captures all necessary information
5. Test retry suggestion accuracy
6. Validate documentation links

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Custom Exception Classes [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a hierarchy of custom exception classes tailored to the application's error scenarios, ensuring clarity and maintainability.
### Details:
Design exception classes that represent different error types (e.g., validation, authentication, business logic) and include relevant attributes for error context.

## 2. Design Error Response Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.1
### Description: Establish a standardized, machine-readable error response structure for API and internal use.
### Details:
Follow best practices such as RFC 9457 (Problem Details), including fields for error code, message, documentation link, and correlation ID.

## 3. Implement Global Error Handler [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.1, 37.2
### Description: Develop a centralized mechanism to catch and process all unhandled exceptions across the application stack.
### Details:
Integrate middleware or framework-level hooks to intercept errors, map them to the error schema, and ensure consistent responses.

## 4. Generate Detailed Error Messages [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.1, 37.2, 37.3
### Description: Ensure all error responses include clear, actionable, and secure messages for both developers and end-users.
### Details:
Craft messages that avoid technical jargon for users, provide debugging context for developers, and never leak sensitive data.

## 5. Map Exceptions to HTTP Status Codes [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.1, 37.3
### Description: Associate each exception type with the appropriate HTTP status code for accurate client communication.
### Details:
Implement logic in the global handler to translate exceptions into status codes (e.g., 400 for validation errors, 500 for server errors).

## 6. Integrate Error Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.3
### Description: Log all errors with sufficient context for troubleshooting, monitoring, and auditing purposes.
### Details:
Use a centralized logging system to capture error details, stack traces, correlation IDs, and user/session information.

## 7. Provide Retry and Resolution Suggestions [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.4, 37.5
### Description: Include actionable guidance in error responses to help clients or users recover from errors when possible.
### Details:
Suggest retry strategies for transient errors and offer next steps or contact information for non-recoverable issues.

## 8. Embed Documentation Links in Error Responses [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.2, 37.4
### Description: Add URLs to relevant documentation or troubleshooting guides within error responses for developer self-service.
### Details:
Ensure each error type includes a link to a knowledge base or API documentation section explaining the error and possible resolutions.

## 9. Set Up Error Tracking and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement tools and processes to track, aggregate, and analyze errors for ongoing improvement.
### Details:
Integrate with error tracking platforms (e.g., Sentry, Datadog) to monitor error rates, trends, and resolution times.
