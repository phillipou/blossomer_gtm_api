# Task ID: 33
# Title: Implement External Search Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21, 26
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate with Bing Search API for market research and competitive intelligence.
# Details:
1. Set up Bing Search API client
2. Create search query generation based on company and ICP
3. Implement market research functionality
4. Add competitive intelligence gathering
5. Create result filtering and relevance scoring
6. Implement rate limiting and quota management
7. Add caching for search results
8. Create error handling for API failures
9. Implement retry mechanism for transient errors

# Test Strategy:
1. Test search query generation quality
2. Verify result relevance for various inputs
3. Test rate limiting compliance
4. Benchmark search performance
5. Verify error handling for API failures
6. Test caching effectiveness

# Subtasks:
## 1. API Client Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize and configure the API client, including authentication, environment variables, and secure storage of credentials.
### Details:
Choose an appropriate API client library, set up authentication (API keys, OAuth, etc.), and configure environment-specific settings for development, testing, and production.

## 2. Query Generation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Develop logic to generate API queries based on user input or business requirements.
### Details:
Implement functions to construct API requests dynamically, ensuring correct endpoint usage, parameter formatting, and adherence to API documentation.

## 3. Market Research Data Retrieval [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.2
### Description: Design and implement API calls to gather market research data from external sources.
### Details:
Identify relevant endpoints and parameters for market research, and ensure data is retrieved in the required format for further processing.

## 4. Competitive Intelligence Data Retrieval [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.2
### Description: Set up API queries to collect competitive intelligence data from appropriate sources.
### Details:
Determine which endpoints provide competitive intelligence, and implement logic to fetch and parse this data as needed.

## 5. Result Filtering and Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.3, 33.4
### Description: Implement logic to filter, validate, and process API responses to extract relevant insights.
### Details:
Apply business rules and filters to raw API data, validate response formats, and transform data for downstream use.

## 6. Rate Limiting Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Implement mechanisms to respect and handle API rate limits.
### Details:
Monitor API usage, handle rate limit headers, and implement backoff or queuing strategies to avoid exceeding limits.

## 7. Caching Layer Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.5
### Description: Design and integrate a caching layer to store frequently accessed API responses and reduce redundant calls.
### Details:
Choose a caching strategy (in-memory, distributed, etc.), define cache keys, and set appropriate expiration policies.

## 8. Error Handling Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1, 33.2
### Description: Develop robust error handling for API integration, including parsing error responses and triggering appropriate actions.
### Details:
Handle network errors, API-specific error codes, and unexpected responses, providing meaningful feedback and logging.

## 9. Retry Mechanism Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.8, 33.6
### Description: Implement retry logic for transient API failures, with exponential backoff and configurable limits.
### Details:
Detect retryable errors, avoid infinite loops, and ensure retries respect rate limits and error handling policies.
