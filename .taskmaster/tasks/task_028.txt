8. Add quality evaluation for generated content
9. Create agent communication protocols
10. Implement workflow optimization

# Test Strategy:
1. Test end-to-end workflow execution
2. Verify memory persistence across steps
3. Test error recovery mechanisms
4. Benchmark workflow performance
5. Verify quality evaluation accuracy
6. Test complex multi-agent interactions

# Subtasks:
## 1. LangGraph Environment Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install LangGraph and its dependencies, configure the project structure, and set up environment variables.
### Details:
Follow official installation guides to set up LangGraph using pip or requirements.txt. Organize the project directory as recommended, including configuration files and environment variables.[1][4][5]

## 2. Agent Role Definition [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.1
### Description: Define the roles, responsibilities, and capabilities of each agent within the system.
### Details:
Specify agent types (e.g., single, multi-agent, hierarchical), their tasks, and the tools or models they will use. Document agent behaviors and interaction protocols.[2][3]

## 3. Workflow Design [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.2
### Description: Design the control flow and orchestration logic for agent interactions and task execution.
### Details:
Map out the sequence of agent actions, decision points, and possible branches. Use LangGraph primitives to implement customizable workflows, including human-in-the-loop steps if needed.[3]

## 4. Memory Persistence Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.3
### Description: Implement persistent memory mechanisms to store and retrieve agent state and context across sessions.
### Details:
Integrate state management and checkpointing features to ensure agents retain relevant information and can recover from failures.[3]

## 5. Context Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.4
### Description: Develop strategies for managing and updating context information shared among agents.
### Details:
Define how context is passed, updated, and synchronized between agents to maintain coherence and relevance throughout workflows.[3]

## 6. Error Handling and Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.5
### Description: Design and implement robust error handling, fault tolerance, and recovery mechanisms.
### Details:
Set up error detection, logging, and fallback strategies. Enable rollback and retry capabilities to maintain workflow integrity.[3]

## 7. Monitoring and Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish monitoring, logging, and alerting systems to track agent performance and system health.
### Details:
Integrate monitoring tools to observe agent actions, workflow progress, and system metrics. Set up logs for debugging and compliance.[3]

## 8. Quality Evaluation and Moderation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement quality control loops and moderation checks to ensure agent outputs meet standards.
### Details:
Add human-in-the-loop review steps, automated validation, and moderation filters to prevent agents from veering off course.[3]

## 9. Communication Protocols Definition [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and implement protocols for agent-to-agent and agent-to-human communication.
### Details:
Specify message formats, APIs, and interaction patterns to ensure reliable and clear communication between all parties.[3]

## 10. System Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize the overall system for scalability, performance, and resource efficiency.
### Details:
Profile workflows, tune agent configurations, and refine orchestration logic to achieve fault-tolerant scalability and efficient operation.[3]
