# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement API Key Authentication and Rate Limiting
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21, 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Create authentication system using API keys with rate limiting capabilities to manage service usage.
# Details:
1. Implement API key generation and validation system
2. Create FastAPI dependency for API key authentication
3. Implement rate limiting middleware using Redis or in-memory solution
4. Add rate limit headers to API responses
5. Create database models for tracking API usage
6. Implement tiered rate limiting based on user plans
7. Add 401 Unauthorized responses for invalid API keys
8. Add 429 Too Many Requests responses for rate limit exceeding
9. Create admin endpoints for API key management
10. Implement usage tracking for billing purposes

# Test Strategy:
1. Test API key validation with valid and invalid keys
2. Verify rate limiting correctly blocks excessive requests
3. Test rate limit headers in responses
4. Benchmark authentication performance
5. Test usage tracking accuracy
6. Verify proper error responses for authentication failures

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design API Key Generation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and implement a secure, unique, and complex API key generation algorithm, ensuring keys are unpredictable and resistant to brute-force attacks.
### Details:
Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. Consider dynamic generation methods and include timestamps or unique identifiers for uniqueness.

## 2. Implement API Key Validation Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Develop logic to validate incoming API keys for authenticity, format, and status (active, expired, revoked).
### Details:
Ensure validation checks for key existence, correct format, and current status in the database or key store.

## 3. Integrate API Key Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.2
### Description: Create middleware to intercept API requests, extract and validate API keys, and enforce authentication before processing requests.
### Details:
Middleware should reject unauthorized or invalid keys and pass valid requests to the appropriate handlers.

## 4. Develop Rate Limiting Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.3
### Description: Implement rate limiting per API key to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage according to plan tiers.
### Details:
Support configurable limits (requests per minute/hour/day) and integrate with middleware for real-time enforcement.

## 5. Build Usage Tracking System [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.4
### Description: Track API usage metrics per key, including request counts, timestamps, and endpoint access for analytics and billing.
### Details:
Store usage data efficiently and ensure it is accessible for reporting and billing purposes.

## 6. Implement Tiered Plan Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.5
### Description: Define and enforce tiered API plans, each with specific rate limits, quotas, and feature access.
### Details:
Associate API keys with plan tiers and ensure rate limiting and usage tracking respect plan constraints.

## 7. Develop Robust Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive error handling for all API key operations, including generation, validation, rate limiting, and usage tracking.
### Details:
Return clear, actionable error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes for all failure scenarios.

## 8. Create Admin Endpoints for Key and Plan Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop secure admin endpoints for managing API keys, user accounts, plan assignments, and monitoring usage.
### Details:
Include endpoints for key rotation, revocation, plan upgrades/downgrades, and usage analytics.

## 9. Integrate Billing System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Connect usage tracking and tiered plans to a billing provider to automate invoicing and payments based on API consumption.
### Details:
Ensure accurate mapping of usage data to billing cycles and support plan upgrades/downgrades with prorated charges.

## 10. Conduct Security Review and Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform thorough security audits and testing of all components, focusing on key storage, validation, rate limiting, and billing integration.
### Details:
Test for vulnerabilities such as key leakage, brute-force attacks, privilege escalation, and billing bypass.
