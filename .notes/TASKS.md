## 🎯 TOP PRIORITY: Email Generation API for Campaign Wizard

### **Email Generation System Implementation (3-4 days) - HIGHEST PRIORITY**
*Build comprehensive email generation API to power the Campaign Wizard*

**Context**: Successfully updated Email Campaign Wizard to use real data from Target Accounts and Personas. Now need to implement the email generation backend that synthesizes all context into compelling, modular emails.

**Requirements Gathered**:
- **Inputs**: Company overview (localStorage), selected target account/persona objects, wizard preferences (use case, emphasis, opening line, CTA)
- **Output**: 3 subjects (1 primary + 2 alternatives), modular email body with segments, breakdown data for UI
- **Must apply Blossomer's best practices** for subject lines and email structure
- **Must generate structured segments** that match existing UI rendering system

#### **Phase 1: API Foundation & Design (1 day)** ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Create endpoint structure** - `POST /api/campaigns/generate-email` in campaigns.py
- [x] **Design request/response schemas** - EmailGenerationRequest/Response in schemas/
- [x] **Set up prompt template system** - Create email_generation.jinja2 with Jinja2
- [x] **Create business logic service** - EmailGenerationService in services/
- [x] **Fix EmailBreakdown schema** - Made flexible to match frontend dictionary structure

**Input Schema Design**:
```typescript
interface EmailGenerationRequest {
  companyContext: CompanyOverviewResponse;  // from localStorage
  targetAccount: TargetAccountResponse;     // selected account
  targetPersona: TargetPersonaResponse;     // selected persona  
  preferences: {
    useCase: string;           // from step 2
    emphasis: string;          // capabilities|pain-point|desired-outcome
    openingLine: string;       // buying-signal|company-research|not-personalized
    ctaSetting: string;        // feedback|meeting|priority-check|free-resource|visit-link
    template: string;          // blossomer (custom disabled)
  };
}
```

**Output Schema Design**:
```typescript
interface EmailGenerationResponse {
  subjects: {
    primary: string;
    alternatives: [string, string];
  };
  emailBody: EmailSegment[];
  breakdown: EmailBreakdown;
  metadata: {
    generationId: string;
    confidence: number;
    personalizationLevel: "high" | "medium" | "low";
  };
}
```

#### **Phase 2: Prompt Engineering & LLM Integration (1-2 days)**
- [ ] **Subject line prompt template** - Apply Blossomer best practices for compelling subjects
- [ ] **Modular email body prompt** - Generate structured segments (greeting, opening, pain-point, solution, evidence, cta, signature)
- [ ] **Context synthesis logic** - Intelligently combine company + account + persona + preferences
- [ ] **Personalization strategies** - Handle different opening line approaches (buying signal vs company research vs generic)
- [ ] **CTA customization** - Generate appropriate calls-to-action based on selected strategy

**Key Prompt Design Decisions**:
- **Single comprehensive prompt vs multiple specialized prompts** - One unified prompt for consistency
- **Context prioritization** - Persona use cases > account buying signals > company capabilities
- **Personalization handling** - Dynamic prompt sections based on opening line preference
- **Segment modularity** - Generate cohesive email that breaks down into logical segments

#### **Phase 3: Frontend Integration (1 day)**
- [ ] **Frontend service layer** - Create emailGenerationService.ts to call API
- [ ] **LocalStorage data extraction** - Extract dashboard_overview and selected wizard data
- [ ] **Update EmailWizardModal** - Connect final step to real API instead of mock generation
- [ ] **Error handling and fallbacks** - Graceful degradation when API fails
- [ ] **Response transformation** - Ensure API response matches existing EmailPreview component expectations

#### **Phase 4: Testing & Polish (0.5-1 day)**
- [ ] **Backend unit tests** - Test email generation service and prompt templates
- [ ] **Frontend integration tests** - Test end-to-end wizard flow with real API
- [ ] **Error scenario testing** - Handle incomplete context, API failures, malformed responses
- [ ] **Quality validation** - Ensure generated emails meet Blossomer standards

### **Implementation Architecture**

```
EmailWizardModal → Extract Context → EmailGenerationService → LLM → Structured Response → EmailPreview
                   ↓
          dashboard_overview (localStorage)
          selectedAccount + selectedPersona
          wizard preferences (steps 2-3)
```

**Context Orchestration Flow**:
1. **Gather company overview** from localStorage dashboard_overview
2. **Extract selected account/persona** full objects from wizard state
3. **Map wizard preferences** to prompt parameters (use case, emphasis, opening line, CTA)
4. **Synthesize comprehensive context** - intelligent prioritization and combination
5. **Generate structured email** with appropriate personalization level
6. **Return modular segments** for existing UI rendering system

### **Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Clean, comprehensive prompt template with Blossomer best practices
- [ ] Well-structured API that handles all input combinations gracefully
- [ ] Generated emails that feel personalized and compelling
- [ ] Seamless integration with existing EmailPreview component
- [ ] Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Fast response times (< 10 seconds for email generation)

**Notes for Implementation**:
- Follow same high-quality prompt engineering patterns from product_overview and target_account
- Use existing LLM singleton and circuit breaker patterns
- Maintain backwards compatibility with existing EmailPreview rendering
- Prioritize email quality over generation speed
- Implement comprehensive logging for debugging and improvement
