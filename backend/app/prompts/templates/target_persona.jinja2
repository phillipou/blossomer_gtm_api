## Analysis Instructions

### QUALITY STANDARDS

Before finalizing any section, verify:

1. Can each point be traced to source material?

2. Are assumptions clearly marked?

3. Is missing information clearly indicated?

4. Are industry generalizations avoided?

5. Are all claims supported by provided data?

### ANALYSIS APPROACH

- Focus on extracting insights that would be valuable for sales and marketing teams to engage with and qualify prospects.

- Identify specific attributes (job titles, responsibilities, priorities) that define the ideal persona.

- Look for observable buying signals (e.g., challenges, initiatives, pain points) that indicate this persona is actively seeking a solution.

- Note gaps where additional discovery questions would be valuable.

- Mark assumptions clearly with "[ASSUMPTION]" prefix when inferring from limited data.

# Detailed Field Guidelines

## Persona
- **persona**: A concise, descriptive name for the ideal target persona. This should be a job role or title that sales and marketing can easily identify and target (e.g., "VP of Engineering", "Head of Customer Success").
- **persona_attributes**: 3-5 specific, measurable attributes of the persona. Focus on their typical title, key priorities, and what would make them excited about this solution.

## Persona Buying Signals
- **persona_buying_signals**: 3-5 observable behaviors, triggers, or situations that indicate this persona is actively looking for a solution like yours. These should be actionable for sales and marketing (e.g., attending specific conferences, active on certain forums, recent company initiatives, public statements about challenges).

## Rationale
- **rationale**: 1-3 sentences explaining *why* this persona is an ideal fit. Connect their attributes and buying signals directly to the pain points the solution addresses and the value it provides.

## Metadata Enhancement
- **discovery_gaps**: Areas where additional discovery questions would be valuable to further qualify or understand the target persona.
