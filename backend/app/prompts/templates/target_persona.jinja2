## Persona Profile Development

**IMPORTANT: Focus on the specific persona type from user input**

Generate a comprehensive profile for the SPECIFIC persona type the user identified, not generic business roles.

### Demographics: Precise Targeting Attributes

**Job Title Precision**: Focus on the exact persona type specified by the user, not generic business titles.

Generate precise targeting criteria for the SPECIFIC persona the user identified.

### Persona Segment Analysis
- **Role Focus**: Build demographics around the exact persona type specified by the user
- **Title Specificity**: If user mentions "VP of Engineering," focus on that specific role and its variations
- **Unique Attributes**: Identify what makes this persona different from other potential buyers

### Job Title Targeting
- **Specific Role Names**: Use exact job titles relevant to the user's specified persona
- **Seniority Logic**: Focus on the specific seniority level that matches the user's target persona
- **Department Alignment**: Consider the department dynamics specific to the user's target persona

### Buying Role Precision
- **Decision Authority**: What level of influence does this persona have in purchasing decisions
- **Stakeholder Relationships**: How they interact with other buying committee members
- **Budget Influence**: Their ability to allocate resources for solutions

### Job Description Keywords
- **Day-to-Day Activities**: What this persona does in their role, not their relationship to the product
- **Core Responsibilities**: Key functions they perform that indicate role fit
- **Operational Focus**: Daily workflows and processes they manage

## Use Cases: Value Proposition Alignment

Generate 3-4 use cases that follow the logical progression: use_case → pain_point → capability → desired_outcome

This follows the Fletch PMM value proposition messaging canvas approach:

### Use Case Development
- **Core Workflows**: Primary processes this persona manages that the product impacts
- **Pain Point Identification**: Specific inefficiencies and frustrations in current workflows
- **Capability Matching**: Relevant product features that address these pain points
- **Outcome Alignment**: Measurable improvements that align with persona success metrics

### Value Proposition Logic
- **Problem-Solution Fit**: Clear connection between persona pain and product capability
- **Business Impact**: Outcomes that matter to this persona's role success
- **Competitive Advantage**: Why this solution beats alternatives for this persona

## Buying Signals: Contact-Level Intent Detection

Generate persona-specific buying signals that indicate this individual is actively seeking a solution and would respond well to outreach.

### Signal Detection Questions:
1. "What signals indicate someone inside that company is most likely trying to solve this problem right now?"
2. "What signals would indicate someone will respond well to cold outreach from this product?"
3. "Who may be so invested in this problem that they can potentially rally others internally?"

### Signal Categories & Examples:

- **LinkedIn Activity**: Profile updates, content engagement, job changes, skill additions, group participation
- **LinkedIn Profile**: Headline keywords, about summary content, experience indicators, skill endorsements
- **Professional Experience**: Previous roles with similar products, tenure patterns, industry transitions
- **Organizational Influence**: Role tenure, team size, budget authority, cross-functional responsibilities
- **Content Consumption**: Industry publications, conference attendance, webinar participation, thought leadership
- **Technology Adoption**: Tool usage patterns, integration experience, technical skill sets

### Priority Guidelines:
- **High (15% of signals)**: Strong predictive indicators of immediate buying intent and outreach receptivity
- **Medium (60% of signals)**: Moderate correlation with purchase likelihood and engagement potential
- **Low (25% of signals)**: Weak but potentially useful qualification signals

### Detection Requirements:
Each signal must specify the Clay enrichment, API, or data source needed to identify it in prospect databases.

## Enhanced Output Validation

### Sophistication Requirements
Your analysis must demonstrate nuanced understanding of this persona's business context, motivations, and decision-making process. Think like a seasoned B2B sales professional who understands the subtle indicators of buying readiness.

### Target Persona Rationale Development
Provide 3-5 compelling bullets explaining why this persona is ideal for the solution:
- Role characteristics that align with solution value
- Organizational context that creates urgency
- Decision-making authority and influence patterns
- Pain points that this solution uniquely addresses
- Why this person would desperately need to buy or use this solution

### Buying Signals Rationale Development
Provide 3-5 compelling bullets explaining your buying signals logic:
- Why these specific signals indicate this person would respond well to outreach/marketing
- How these signals differentiate engaged prospects from uninterested contacts
- Persona-specific indicators that suggest solution receptivity
- Detection strategies that enable targeted outreach

### Purchase Journey Mapping
Provide 3-6 bullet points highlighting their path from awareness to consideration to purchase:
- Content consumption patterns
- Information gathering behaviors
- Decision triggers that move them between stages
- Final purchase catalysts

## Critical Requirements

**Actionable Specificity**: Every element must be actionable for sales and marketing teams:
- Job titles: Specific enough to target in LinkedIn or CRM searches
- Buying signals: Observable enough to detect through prospecting tools

**Quality Transparency**: Metadata must clearly indicate:
