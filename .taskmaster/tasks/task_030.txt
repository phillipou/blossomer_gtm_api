# Task ID: 30
# Title: Implement Email Campaign Pack Generation Endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 23, 24, 25, 26, 28
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the /campaigns/email endpoint to generate email campaign assets including subject lines and email sequences.
# Details:
1. Create FastAPI endpoint for /campaigns/email
2. Implement request validation using Pydantic
3. Create email campaign generation workflow:
   - Generate three optimized subject line variations
   - Create initial outreach email with value-focused messaging
   - Create strategic follow-up email
   - Calibrate tone for B2B decision-makers
   - Add personalization placeholders
4. Structure JSON response format
5. Add A/B testing recommendations
6. Implement error handling for insufficient information
7. Add quality scoring for generated content
8. Create caching mechanism for repeated requests
9. Implement response streaming for long-running operations

# Test Strategy:
1. Test endpoint with various website inputs
2. Verify response structure matches schema
3. Test with both user-provided and inferred ICPs
4. Benchmark endpoint performance
5. Verify error handling for edge cases
6. Test streaming response functionality
7. Validate email content quality and personalization

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define RESTful endpoints for email content workflow, ensuring proper naming conventions, resource structure, and versioning.
### Details:
Endpoints should use nouns, be consistent, and follow RESTful principles. Include versioning in the URL or headers.

## 2. Implement Input Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.1
### Description: Develop validation logic for incoming requests to ensure all required fields and formats are correct for email content and A/B testing.
### Details:
Check for required fields, data types, and constraints specific to email content and A/B test parameters.

## 3. Develop Workflow Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.2
### Description: Implement the core workflow for processing email content, including logic for A/B testing recommendations.
### Details:
Handle business logic for generating, storing, and managing email content and A/B test variants.

## 4. Format API Responses [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.3
### Description: Standardize and implement consistent response formatting for all endpoints, including success and error responses.
### Details:
Ensure responses include appropriate HTTP status codes, metadata, and follow a consistent schema.

## 5. Integrate A/B Testing Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.3
### Description: Add logic to support A/B testing, including variant assignment, tracking, and recommendation generation.
### Details:
Enable endpoints to create, retrieve, and manage A/B test groups and their results.

## 6. Implement Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.4
### Description: Develop robust error handling mechanisms for all endpoints, ensuring meaningful and consistent error responses.
### Details:
Use appropriate HTTP status codes and provide detailed error messages in a standardized format.

## 7. Add Quality Scoring Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.3
### Description: Implement logic to score email content quality and include scores in relevant API responses.
### Details:
Define scoring criteria and ensure scores are calculated and returned as part of the workflow.

## 8. Implement Caching Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.4
### Description: Add caching to optimize performance for frequently accessed endpoints and data.
### Details:
Determine which responses or data should be cached and implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies.

## 9. Enable Streaming Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.4
### Description: Implement streaming capabilities for endpoints that require real-time or large data delivery.
### Details:
Support chunked or event-based responses for workflows that benefit from streaming, such as live A/B test updates.
