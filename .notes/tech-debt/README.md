# Tech Debt Management

This directory contains technical debt assessments and cleanup tracking for the Blossomer GTM API project.

## Assessment History

- **[2025-07-05-assessment.md](./2025-07-05-assessment.md)** - Initial comprehensive tech debt analysis
  - **Result**: Medium tech debt level (manageable)
  - **Recommendation**: 2-3 days of immediate cleanup before feature work
  - **Status**: Cleanup tasks added to TASKS.md

## Assessment Guidelines

### When to Assess
- Before major feature development
- After significant codebase changes
- Quarterly review cycles
- When development velocity feels impacted

### Assessment Format
Use filename pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-assessment.md`

### Categories to Evaluate
1. **Code Quality**: Unused imports, duplicate code, dead code
2. **Architecture**: File organization, separation of concerns
3. **Maintainability**: File sizes, complexity, documentation
4. **Performance**: Bottlenecks, optimization opportunities
5. **Testing**: Coverage, test quality, integration tests
6. **Security**: Vulnerabilities, best practices compliance

### Priority Levels
- **High**: Blocks development, causes bugs, security issues
- **Medium**: Reduces velocity, maintenance burden
- **Low**: Nice-to-have, future optimization

### Action Items
All action items should be added to the main [TASKS.md](../TASKS.md) with appropriate priorities and timelines.
