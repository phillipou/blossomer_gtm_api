# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Database Models and Migrations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21
# Priority: high
# Description: Create database models for users, campaigns, website content, and vector embeddings. Set up database connection and migration system.
# Details:
1. Create SQLAlchemy models for:
   - User: Store user information and API key associations
   - Campaign: Store generated campaign assets and metadata
   - WebsiteContent: Store scraped and processed website information
   - VectorEmbedding: Integration with ChromaDB for semantic search
2. Set up SQLite for development and configure PostgreSQL connection for production
3. Implement Alembic migrations for schema versioning
4. Create database session management with connection pooling
5. Implement base CRUD operations for each model
6. Add indexes for performance optimization
7. Implement data retention policies as specified in PRD

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for each model's CRUD operations
2. Test migrations up and down
3. Verify foreign key constraints and relationships
4. Benchmark query performance for common operations
5. Test database connection pooling under load

## 5. Implement CRUD Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1, 22.4
### Description: Develop Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for each model, ensuring data integrity and validation.
### Details:
Follow RESTful or other relevant API standards, and include error handling and input validation.

## 6. Design and Apply Indexing Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1, 22.4
### Description: Analyze query patterns and add indexes to optimize performance for frequent queries and relationships.
### Details:
Balance read/write performance, avoid unnecessary indexes, and document indexing decisions.

## 7. Implement Session Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.2, 22.3, 22.5
### Description: Design and integrate session management to handle user authentication, authorization, and session persistence.
### Details:
Choose appropriate session storage (in-memory, database, etc.), enforce session expiration, and secure session data.

## 8. Enforce Data Retention Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.3, 22.5
### Description: Define and implement policies for data retention, archival, and deletion in accordance with legal and business requirements.
### Details:
Automate data purging, ensure compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR), and document retention schedules.

## 9. Test and Validate Database Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.5, 22.6, 22.7, 22.8
### Description: Conduct comprehensive testing of models, migrations, CRUD operations, indexing, session management, and retention policies.
### Details:
Perform unit, integration, and performance tests; validate data integrity and compliance with requirements.

## 10. Content Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.5
### Description: Store the cleaned data in a structured format for further processing.
### Details:
Save data to databases, files, or cloud storage in formats such as JSON, CSV, or SQL.

## 11. Content Embedding [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Generate vector embeddings or other representations for the stored content.
### Details:
Use NLP models or embedding APIs to convert text into vector representations for downstream tasks.

## 12. Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement caching mechanisms to avoid redundant scraping and speed up repeated requests.
### Details:
Cache raw HTML, extracted data, or embeddings using in-memory or persistent storage solutions.
