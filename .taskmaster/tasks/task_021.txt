# Task ID: 21
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with Python 3.11+, FastAPI, and required dependencies. Set up development environment with proper configuration for different environments.
# Details:
1. Create a new GitHub repository for the Blossomer GTM API
2. Initialize Python project with Poetry or pip for dependency management
3. Set up Python 3.11+ virtual environment
4. Install core dependencies:
   - FastAPI and Uvicorn for API framework
   - Pydantic for data validation
   - SQLAlchemy for database ORM
   - Alembic for database migrations
   - LangChain and LangGraph for LLM orchestration
   - ChromaDB for vector storage
   - pytest for testing
5. Configure environment variables for development, testing, and production
6. Set up pre-commit hooks with Black and MyPy
7. Create initial README.md with project overview and setup instructions
8. Implement directory structure as outlined in the PRD

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all dependencies install correctly
2. Ensure pre-commit hooks run successfully
3. Confirm Python 3.11+ compatibility
4. Test environment variable loading across different configurations
