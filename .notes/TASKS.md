## Frontend Integration & Dashboard Prototype
- [x] FE-1: Scaffold `frontend/` app (React + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS + MSW)
    - Scaffolded frontend app with React, TypeScript, Vite, and TailwindCSS. Tailwind manually configured due to npx/npm exec issues.
- [x] FE-1.1: Add React, Vite, and Tailwind best practices rules to .cursor/rules and reference them in cursor_rules.mdc.
- [x] FE-2: Configure TailwindCSS with design tokens (add placeholder if not available)
    - TailwindCSS configured with design tokens from design-system v1.1.0.
- [x] FE-3: Set up MSW with mock handlers for all major endpoints
    - MSW set up with handlers for all major endpoints, mock/live switching documented in README, and integrated into app entry.
- [x] FE-4: Implement API proxy for backend integration (dev only)
    - Vite dev server proxy configured for API integration with FastAPI backend at http://localhost:8000.
- [x] FE-5: Scaffold main pages: Landing (`/`), Dashboard (`/dashboard`), Desktop-only splash
    - Modernized landing page using shadcn/ui, Lucide React, and Tailwind. Routing set up with React Router. Layout and design tokens applied. All config and alias issues resolved. PostCSS config fixed for ESM.
- [ ] FE-6: Stub core components: `ContentBlock`, `AttributeBlock`, `UpdateBadge`, `DiffViewer`, `SkeletonCard`, `ErrorBanner`, `Toast`, `ApiKeyModal`
- [ ] FE-7: Implement authentication modals and flows (Sign-up, Login)
- [ ] FE-8: Wire up initial Company/Customers/Campaigns flows with mock data
- [ ] FE-9: Add environment switch (mock/live backend)
- [ ] FE-10: Document FE setup and dev workflow in `README.md`
- [~] FE-11: Refactor and modularize design system components for reuse across the frontend
    - Begin extracting shared UI primitives (Button, Card, Input, Textarea, Label, etc.) and design tokens into a reusable, extensible component library for consistent styling and rapid development.
    - **All atomic UI primitives are now extracted to `src/components/ui/` and are the canonical source for all UI primitives.**
    - **All new UI work should use these primitives.**
    - Storybook is set up for live documentation and visual testing of UI primitives.
    - Subtasks:
        - [x] Extract Button to `src/components/ui/button.tsx`
        - [x] Extract Card to `src/components/ui/card.tsx`
        - [x] Extract Input to `src/components/ui/input.tsx`
        - [x] Extract Textarea to `src/components/ui/textarea.tsx`
        - [x] Extract Label to `src/components/ui/label.tsx`
        - [~] Document usage and extension patterns in README and architecture docs (in progress)

## Frontend Deployment
- [ ] FE-DEPLOY-1: Build production assets with `npm run build`
- [ ] FE-DEPLOY-2: Deploy frontend as a Render Static Site (build command: npm run build, publish dir: dist, root dir: frontend)
- [ ] FE-DEPLOY-3: Set production environment variables (e.g., VITE_API_MOCK=0, API base URL)
- [ ] FE-DEPLOY-4: Test production deployment and document the process in README.md
