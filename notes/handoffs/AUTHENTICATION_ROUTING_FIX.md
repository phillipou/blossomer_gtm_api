# Authentication Routing Fix — Handoff Documentation

## Issue Summary
- **Date**: 2025-07-09  
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED — Core authentication routing fixed, remaining bugs identified

---

### Problem Description
Authenticated users were incorrectly hitting `/demo` endpoints instead of `/api` endpoints. The Personas, Campaigns, and Accounts pages were all calling demo endpoints even when users had valid tokens.

---

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in `getAuthState()` (`/frontend/src/lib/auth.ts`), which was hardcoded to return `isAuthenticated: false` outside component usage. This caused:

1. `shouldUseAuthenticatedEndpoints()` to return `false`
2. `getApiBasePath()` to return `/demo` instead of `/api`
3. All API calls to default to demo endpoints, even when authenticated

---

### Solution Implemented

**Fixed auth state management in `/frontend/src/lib/auth.ts`:**

1. **Added global auth state store:**
   ```ts
   let globalAuthState: AuthState = {
     isAuthenticated: false,
     token: null,
     userInfo: null
   };
