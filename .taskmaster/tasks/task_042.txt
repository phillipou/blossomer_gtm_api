# Task ID: 42
# Title: Implement Security Measures
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21, 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive security measures for the API.
# Details:
1. Enforce HTTPS for all endpoints
2. Implement secure API key storage
3. Add request rate limiting for security
4. Create input validation for all endpoints
5. Implement output sanitization
6. Add CORS configuration
7. Create security headers
8. Implement dependency scanning
9. Add vulnerability monitoring
10. Create security documentation

# Test Strategy:
1. Test HTTPS enforcement
2. Verify API key security
3. Test rate limiting for security purposes
4. Validate input validation effectiveness
5. Test CORS configuration
6. Verify security headers are present
7. Run dependency vulnerability scans

# Subtasks:
## 1. Enforce HTTPS Across All Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure all API endpoints and web interfaces use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
### Details:
Update server configurations to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS and obtain valid TLS certificates.

## 2. Implement Secure API Key Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Store API keys and secrets securely to prevent unauthorized access and leakage.
### Details:
Use environment variables or secure vaults for API key storage; avoid hardcoding secrets in source code.

## 3. Configure Rate Limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up rate limiting to protect APIs from abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
### Details:
Define thresholds for requests per user/IP and implement logic to enforce these limits.

## 4. Validate All Input Data [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement input validation to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
### Details:
Apply strict validation rules for all incoming data, including type checks, length limits, and format validation.

## 5. Sanitize Output Data [pending]
### Dependencies: 42.4
### Description: Sanitize all output to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and data leakage.
### Details:
Escape or remove potentially dangerous characters from output before sending responses to clients.

## 6. Configure CORS Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to control which domains can access the API.
### Details:
Define allowed origins, methods, and headers in server configuration to restrict cross-origin requests.

## 7. Set Security Headers [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add security-related HTTP headers to API responses to mitigate common web vulnerabilities.
### Details:
Implement headers such as Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and Strict-Transport-Security.

## 8. Perform Dependency Scanning [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Scan all project dependencies for known vulnerabilities and outdated packages.
### Details:
Use automated tools to regularly check for and remediate vulnerable libraries and frameworks.

## 9. Set Up Vulnerability Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement continuous monitoring for new vulnerabilities in the application and its dependencies.
### Details:
Integrate vulnerability monitoring tools and set up alerts for newly discovered issues.

## 10. Document Security Controls and Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: 42.1, 42.2, 42.3, 42.4, 42.5, 42.6, 42.7, 42.8, 42.9
### Description: Create and maintain documentation for all implemented security measures and operational procedures.
### Details:
Ensure documentation is accessible, up-to-date, and covers configuration, usage, and incident response.
