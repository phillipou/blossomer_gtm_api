# Task ID: 39
# Title: Implement API Documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 23, 29, 30, 31, 32, 37
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger integration.
# Details:
1. Configure FastAPI automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
2. Add detailed descriptions for all endpoints
3. Document request and response schemas
4. Create example requests and responses
5. Add authentication documentation
6. Document error responses and status codes
7. Create usage guides and tutorials
8. Add rate limiting documentation
9. Implement versioning information

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify documentation accuracy for all endpoints
2. Test example requests functionality
3. Verify schema documentation is complete
4. Test documentation rendering in Swagger UI
5. Validate authentication documentation
6. Test documentation accessibility

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up OpenAPI/Swagger Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure the OpenAPI/Swagger tooling in the project environment to enable API documentation generation and editing.
### Details:
Choose appropriate tools (e.g., Swagger UI, SwaggerHub, or OpenAPI CLI), integrate them into the codebase, and ensure the basic configuration is operational.

## 2. Document API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 39.1
### Description: Describe all available API endpoints, including HTTP methods, paths, and summaries of their functionality.
### Details:
List each endpoint, provide concise descriptions, and ensure all routes are covered in the OpenAPI specification.

## 3. Define Request and Response Schemas [pending]
### Dependencies: 39.2
### Description: Document the structure of request and response bodies for each endpoint using OpenAPI schema definitions.
### Details:
Use JSON Schema or YAML to specify data types, required fields, and nested objects for all payloads.

## 4. Add Example Requests and Responses [pending]
### Dependencies: 39.3
### Description: Provide example payloads and responses for each endpoint to illustrate typical usage.
### Details:
Include realistic sample data for both requests and responses in the documentation to aid developer understanding.

## 5. Document Authentication Methods [pending]
### Dependencies: 39.1
### Description: Specify the authentication mechanisms required for accessing the API, such as API keys, OAuth, or JWT.
### Details:
Clearly indicate which endpoints require authentication and describe how clients should provide credentials.

## 6. Describe Standard Error Responses [pending]
### Dependencies: 39.3
### Description: Document common error responses, including status codes, error formats, and example error messages.
### Details:
Define standard error objects and provide examples for typical failure scenarios (e.g., 400, 401, 404, 500).

## 7. Write API Usage Guides [pending]
### Dependencies: 39.4, 39.5, 39.6
### Description: Create guides and tutorials to help developers understand how to use the API effectively.
### Details:
Include step-by-step instructions, code samples, and best practices for common integration scenarios.

## 8. Document Rate Limiting Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: 39.2
### Description: Specify any rate limiting rules, quotas, and headers used to communicate limits to API consumers.
### Details:
Describe how rate limits are enforced, how clients are notified, and what happens when limits are exceeded.

## 9. Implement and Document API Versioning [pending]
### Dependencies: 39.2
### Description: Define the versioning strategy for the API and document how clients should specify or discover the API version.
### Details:
Explain versioning in endpoint paths, headers, or parameters, and provide guidance on handling breaking changes.
