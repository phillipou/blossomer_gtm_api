# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement Website URL Processing Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21, 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Create service to process website URLs, extract content, and store for campaign generation.
# Details:
1. Implement website URL validation
2. Integrate with BeautifulSoup4 and Requests for basic web scraping
3. Prepare for Firecrawl.dev API integration for dynamic content
4. Extract key website content including:
   - Value propositions
   - Product descriptions
   - Company information
   - Pricing details
5. Implement content cleaning and preprocessing
6. Store extracted content in database
7. Create vector embeddings of content for semantic search
8. Implement caching mechanism for website content
9. Add error handling for inaccessible websites
10. Create retry mechanism for transient failures

# Test Strategy:
1. Test URL validation with valid and invalid URLs
2. Verify content extraction from various website types
3. Test handling of protected/login-required websites
4. Benchmark scraping performance
5. Verify error handling for various failure scenarios
6. Test caching mechanism effectiveness
