# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement ICP Processing and Inference Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21, 22, 24
# Priority: high
# Description: Create service to process user-provided ICP descriptions or infer ICP from website content.
# Details:
1. Implement parsing of free-form ICP descriptions
2. Create structured schema for ICP data
3. Integrate with LangChain for NLP processing
4. Implement ICP inference algorithm using website content
5. Create confidence scoring for inferred ICPs
6. Store ICP data (user-provided or inferred) in database
7. Add metadata to indicate ICP source (user-provided vs. inferred)
8. Implement ICP validation and enhancement
9. Create ICP comparison functionality
10. Add error handling for insufficient information scenarios

# Test Strategy:
1. Test parsing of various ICP description formats
2. Verify inference quality from different website types
3. Test confidence scoring accuracy
4. Benchmark ICP processing performance
5. Verify metadata correctly indicates ICP source
6. Test error handling for edge cases

# Subtasks:
## 1. Parsing Natural Language Input [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a module to parse and preprocess user input, handling tokenization, normalization, and ambiguity detection.
### Details:
This subtask involves breaking down raw user queries into structured components, identifying key entities, and preparing the data for downstream NLP processing.

## 2. Schema Design and Metadata Definition [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design a normalized, intuitive database schema with descriptive column names and rich metadata to facilitate accurate mapping from natural language to structured queries.
### Details:
Ensure the schema supports clear relationships and includes metadata annotations (e.g., units, descriptions) to aid NLP mapping and inference.

## 3. NLP Model Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1, 25.2
### Description: Integrate NLP models or APIs capable of interpreting parsed input and mapping it to schema elements, supporting synonym mapping and context awareness.
### Details:
Leverage modular integration strategies and middleware to connect NLP components with the core system, enabling both legacy and NLP-driven command execution.

## 4. Inference Logic Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.3
### Description: Develop logic to infer user intent, resolve ambiguities, and generate structured queries or actions based on NLP outputs and schema metadata.
### Details:
Implement clarification prompts for ambiguous input and context tracking for multi-turn interactions.

## 5. Confidence Scoring Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.4
### Description: Design and implement a confidence scoring system to quantify the reliability of NLP interpretations and inferences.
### Details:
Use model outputs, ambiguity detection, and metadata alignment to assign confidence scores, triggering clarification when scores fall below thresholds.

## 6. Data Storage and Retrieval [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2
### Description: Set up robust storage solutions for both structured data (schema, metadata) and unstructured data (user queries, logs, NLP outputs).
### Details:
Ensure efficient retrieval and update mechanisms, supporting both transactional and analytical workloads.

## 7. Metadata Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2, 25.6
### Description: Develop processes for maintaining, updating, and exposing metadata about schema elements, relationships, and NLP mappings.
### Details:
Metadata should be accessible to both inference logic and NLP modules to improve mapping accuracy and explainability.

## 8. Validation and Quality Assurance [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.4, 25.6
### Description: Implement validation routines to check the correctness of parsed input, NLP mappings, inference results, and stored data.
### Details:
Include automated tests, schema validation, and user feedback loops to ensure system reliability and continuous improvement.

## 9. Comparison and Evaluation Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.5, 25.8
### Description: Build tools to compare inferred outputs against ground truth or alternative interpretations, supporting A/B testing and performance benchmarking.
### Details:
Enable systematic evaluation of NLP, inference, and confidence scoring modules to guide iterative development.

## 10. Error Handling and Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1, 25.3, 25.4, 25.8
### Description: Design comprehensive error handling strategies, including fallback mechanisms, user notifications, and logging for debugging and auditability.
### Details:
Ensure that errors in parsing, NLP, inference, or storage do not compromise system integrity or user experience.
