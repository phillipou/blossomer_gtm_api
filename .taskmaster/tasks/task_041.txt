# Task ID: 41
# Title: Implement Containerization and Deployment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21, 22, 23, 40
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create Docker containerization and deployment configuration for the API.
# Details:
1. Create Dockerfile for application
2. Set up docker-compose for local development
3. Implement environment-specific configuration
4. Create deployment scripts for Render or Railway
5. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
6. Implement database migration in deployment process
7. Add health checks for container orchestration
8. Create backup and restore procedures
9. Implement scaling configuration
10. Add monitoring integration in deployment

# Test Strategy:
1. Test container builds in CI/CD pipeline
2. Verify environment configuration loading
3. Test deployment to staging environment
4. Validate database migration process
5. Test scaling behavior
6. Verify health check functionality in container

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Dockerfile for Application [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Write a Dockerfile that defines the application's container image, following best practices for security, efficiency, and maintainability.
### Details:
Include multi-stage builds, proper user permissions, and .dockerignore usage. Ensure the image is minimal and only contains necessary dependencies.

## 2. Set Up docker-compose Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.1
### Description: Develop a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate multi-container setups, defining services, networks, and volumes.
### Details:
Specify service dependencies, environment variables, and persistent storage. Ensure compatibility with the Dockerfile.

## 3. Define Environment Configuration Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.2
### Description: Establish a system for managing environment-specific configuration, such as .env files or secrets management.
### Details:
Document required environment variables and ensure secure handling of sensitive data.

## 4. Develop Deployment Automation Scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.3
### Description: Create scripts to automate deployment tasks, including building images, pushing to registries, and launching containers.
### Details:
Scripts should support different environments (dev, staging, production) and integrate with docker-compose.

## 5. Integrate CI/CD Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.4
### Description: Set up a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to automate testing, building, and deployment of containers.
### Details:
Configure pipeline to trigger on code changes, run tests, build Docker images, and deploy to target environments.

## 6. Integrate Database Migration Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.5
### Description: Add migration tools or scripts to handle database schema changes as part of the deployment process.
### Details:
Ensure migrations run automatically during deployment and are idempotent.

## 7. Implement Health Check Endpoints and Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add health check endpoints to the application and configure Docker and docker-compose to use them.
### Details:
Define healthcheck instructions in Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for automated container health monitoring.

## 8. Develop Backup and Restore Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create scripts and documentation for backing up and restoring application data and configuration.
### Details:
Automate regular backups and provide tested restore procedures for disaster recovery.

## 9. Design and Implement Scaling Strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure docker-compose and deployment scripts to support horizontal scaling of services.
### Details:
Document scaling procedures and ensure stateless services can be replicated as needed.

## 10. Integrate Monitoring and Alerting Solutions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up monitoring tools to track application and infrastructure health, and configure alerting for critical events.
### Details:
Integrate with existing monitoring stacks (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) and ensure visibility into logs, metrics, and health checks.
