# Task ID: 31
# Title: Implement Enrichment Blueprint Generation Endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 23, 24, 25, 26, 28
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the /campaigns/enrichment endpoint to generate data enrichment guidance for lead qualification.
# Details:
1. Create FastAPI endpoint for /campaigns/enrichment
2. Implement request validation using Pydantic
3. Create enrichment blueprint generation workflow:
   - Generate firmographic data points for qualification
   - Create technographic data points for targeting
   - Add personalization data points for outreach
   - Include source recommendations
   - Add collection methods
4. Structure JSON response format
5. Implement integration with Clearbit/Apollo APIs
6. Add error handling for insufficient information
7. Create caching mechanism for repeated requests
8. Implement response streaming for long-running operations

# Test Strategy:
1. Test endpoint with various website inputs
2. Verify response structure matches schema
3. Test with both user-provided and inferred ICPs
4. Benchmark endpoint performance
5. Verify error handling for edge cases
6. Test streaming response functionality
7. Validate enrichment recommendations quality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define API Endpoint Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design RESTful endpoint paths using nouns, consistent naming conventions, and versioning strategies.
### Details:
Follow RESTful principles and best practices for endpoint naming, resource representation, and versioning as recommended in industry guidelines.

## 2. Implement Input Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.1
### Description: Develop validation logic for incoming requests to ensure data integrity and prevent malformed or malicious input.
### Details:
Validate request parameters, body, and headers according to the API specification. Return appropriate error responses for invalid input.

## 3. Design Workflow Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.2
### Description: Define and implement the core workflow for processing requests, including business logic and orchestration steps.
### Details:
Map out the sequence of operations, including enrichment recommendation generation and integration points.

## 4. Integrate External APIs [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.3
### Description: Connect and interact with required external APIs to fetch or enrich data as part of the workflow.
### Details:
Implement robust integration logic, handle authentication, and manage API rate limits and failures.

## 5. Format API Responses [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.4
### Description: Standardize the structure of API responses, including success and error payloads, using consistent schemas.
### Details:
Ensure responses include necessary metadata, pagination (if applicable), and follow a uniform format for both data and errors.

## 6. Implement Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 31.5
### Description: Develop a consistent error handling mechanism that uses appropriate HTTP status codes and detailed error messages.
### Details:
Return structured error responses with error codes, messages, and context. Ensure all failure scenarios are covered.

## 7. Add Caching Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Introduce caching strategies to optimize performance and reduce redundant external API calls.
### Details:
Implement caching at appropriate layers (e.g., in-memory, distributed) and define cache invalidation policies.

## 8. Enable Streaming Support [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement streaming capabilities for endpoints that require real-time or incremental data delivery.
### Details:
Use appropriate protocols (e.g., HTTP streaming, WebSockets) and ensure compatibility with response formatting and error handling.

## 9. Conduct Complexity and Integration Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test the complete workflow, including API integrations, enrichment logic, and streaming, to ensure correctness and performance.
### Details:
Perform end-to-end tests covering all scenarios, including error cases, caching effectiveness, and streaming reliability.
