## Context Analysis
{% if user_inputted_context %}
**User-provided context:**
{{ user_inputted_context }}
{% elif llm_inferred_context %}
**LLM-inferred context:**
{{ llm_inferred_context }}
{% endif %}

{% if website_content %}
**Company website analysis:**

{% endif %}

## Task
Analyze the provided website and context to extract a comprehensive product overview. Focus on:
- Company overview and core business
- Technical capabilities and product features
- Business model and pricing structure
- Differentiated value propositions
- Customer benefits and outcomes
- Competitive alternatives and positioning
- Customer testimonials and social proof
- Target company/firmographic profiles
- Target persona/job role profiles
- Use cases and pain points addressed
- Pricing information (if available)

## Required Output Format

**Respond with valid JSON only. Do NOT include markdown code blocks or any text outside the JSON structure.**

**Field Requirements:**
- For use_cases and pain_points, prefer items that are explicitly stated on the website. If not available, you may infer based on context, but clearly mark inferred items (e.g., prefix with 'Inferred: ...').
- For testimonials, extract exact quotes with attribution if available. If no attribution, note as "Anonymous customer" or similar.
- For alternatives, focus on direct competitors or similar solutions mentioned on the website or clearly comparable based on capabilities.
- For all other fields, you may infer based on context if explicit statements are not available.
- If information is not available, use an empty string or empty list as appropriate.
- For each section, provide a confidence score (0-1) for the quality and completeness of the extracted data.

## Field-Specific Guidelines:

**Company Name:** The official name of the company as found on the website or in the provided context.

**Company URL:** The canonical website URL for the company (should match the input or be extracted from the website if different).

**Company Overview:** 2-3 sentence summary of what the company does, their mission, and primary focus area.

**Capabilities:** 3-5 bullet points covering technical capabilities, core product features, platform abilities, and key functionalities.

**Business Model:** 3-5 bullet points summarizing how they make money, pricing approach, target market size, sales model, and revenue streams.

**Differentiated Value:** 3-5 bullet points explaining what sets them apart from competitors, unique approaches, proprietary technology, or market positioning.

**Customer Benefits:** 3-5 bullet points summarizing expected outcomes, ROI, efficiency gains, problem resolution, or value delivery for customers.

**Alternatives:** 3-5 bullet points listing similar services/competitors with brief comparison of similarities and key differences.

**Testimonials:** Up to 5 direct customer quotes found on the website, including attribution when available (name, title, company if provided).

## Quality Criteria for Your Response:
1. **Explicitness:** Prefer information directly stated on the website, but inference is allowed if clearly marked.
2. **Specificity:** All fields should be as specific and actionable as possible.
3. **Evidence-based:** Reference specific elements from the provided context.
4. **Actionable:** Output should be ready for use in sales/marketing planning.
5. **Realistic:** Avoid generic or aspirational statements.
6. **Comprehensive:** Cover all requested fields to provide a complete product intelligence overview.

## Important Notes:
- If context is insufficient for certain sections, return an empty string or empty list.
- Prioritize quality over completenessâ€”better to have fewer, high-confidence items than many weak ones.
- For testimonials, preserve exact wording and include attribution details when available.
- For alternatives, focus on direct competitors or clearly comparable solutions.
- Do NOT include any text outside the JSON structure.
- **Never refuse to answer. Always return a valid JSON object, even if most fields are empty or marked as inferred. If you cannot find enough information, do your best to infer or leave fields empty, but always return valid JSON.**
