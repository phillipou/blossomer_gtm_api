## Quality Criteria for Your Response:
1. **Specificity:** Every criterion should be measurable and identifiable through sales tools
2. **Evidence-based:** Reference specific elements from the provided context
3. **Actionable:** Sales teams should be able to immediately build prospect lists
4. **Realistic:** Based on actual market dynamics, not aspirational thinking
5. **Differentiated:** Highlight what makes this ICP unique vs. generic profiles

## Important Notes:
- If context is insufficient for certain sections, explicitly state "Insufficient data to determine [specific criterion]"
- Prioritize quality over completeness - better to have fewer, high-confidence criteria than many weak ones
- Include specific numbers, percentages, and timeframes wherever possible
- Consider both positive signals (what to look for) and negative signals (what to avoid)
