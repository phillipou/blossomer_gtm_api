# Task ID: 36
# Title: Implement Streaming Response Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 29, 30, 31, 32
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create server-sent events streaming for long-running campaign generation processes.
# Details:
1. Implement server-sent events (SSE) in FastAPI
2. Create streaming response format
3. Add progress updates at workflow milestones
4. Implement connection management
5. Add error handling during streaming
6. Create reconnection logic for interrupted streams
7. Implement final response formatting
8. Add streaming support to all campaign endpoints
9. Create client examples for consuming streaming responses

# Test Strategy:
1. Test streaming with various client implementations
2. Verify progress updates are sent correctly
3. Test connection interruption handling
4. Benchmark streaming performance
5. Verify final response formatting
6. Test error handling during streaming

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze SSE Requirements and Use Cases [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify the specific requirements for implementing Server-Sent Events (SSE), including the types of data to be streamed, expected update frequency, and client compatibility needs.
### Details:
Review project goals and determine where real-time streaming is necessary. Document use cases such as progress updates, notifications, or data feeds.

## 2. Design Streaming Data Format [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.1
### Description: Define the format of the streamed data, including event structure, message types, and payload schema for progress updates and final results.
### Details:
Decide on fields such as event type, data, and optional IDs. Ensure the format is compatible with the EventSource API and can be easily parsed by clients.

## 3. Implement SSE Endpoint on Server [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.2
### Description: Develop the server-side endpoint that streams events using the SSE protocol, setting appropriate headers and managing the event stream lifecycle.
### Details:
Set Content-Type to 'text/event-stream', disable caching, and keep the connection alive. Ensure the endpoint can send multiple events and close the stream when complete.

## 4. Integrate Progress Updates into Stream [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.3
### Description: Add logic to emit progress updates and intermediate results as SSE messages during long-running tasks or processes.
### Details:
Implement hooks or callbacks in backend processes to send progress events. Ensure updates are sent at meaningful intervals and in the agreed format.

## 5. Handle Connection Management and Keep-Alive [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.3
### Description: Ensure the SSE connection remains open as needed, sending periodic keep-alive messages if necessary, and properly closing the connection when the stream ends.
### Details:
Implement logic to detect client disconnects, send heartbeat messages, and gracefully terminate the stream on completion or error.

## 6. Implement Error Handling and Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.5
### Description: Add robust error handling for both server and client, including sending error events, logging failures, and managing unexpected disconnects.
### Details:
Define error event format, handle exceptions in the server logic, and ensure clients can distinguish between recoverable and fatal errors.

## 7. Support Client Reconnection Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enable clients to automatically reconnect to the SSE endpoint after network interruptions, resuming from the last received event if possible.
### Details:
Leverage the EventSource API's built-in reconnection features and implement event IDs for resuming missed messages.

## 8. Finalize Output Formatting and Stream Closure [pending]
### Dependencies: 36.4, 36.7
### Description: Ensure the final event or message signals completion, and the stream is properly closed with any necessary cleanup on both server and client sides.
### Details:
Send a final 'completed' event or similar marker, close the HTTP response, and release resources.

## 9. Develop and Document Client Integration Examples [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create example client code demonstrating how to connect to the SSE endpoint, handle progress updates, errors, and stream completion.
### Details:
Provide JavaScript examples using EventSource, including event listeners for message, error, and open events, and document integration steps.
