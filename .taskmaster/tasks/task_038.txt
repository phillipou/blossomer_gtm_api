# Title: Implement Caching System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 24, 29, 30, 31, 32
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create intelligent caching of website analysis and generated assets for improved performance.
# Details:
1. Design caching strategy for different data types
2. Implement in-memory caching for development
3. Set up Redis for production caching
4. Create cache key generation logic
5. Implement time-based cache expiration
6. Add manual cache invalidation endpoints
7. Create cache hit/miss tracking
8. Implement cache warming for common requests
9. Add cache size monitoring and management

# Test Strategy:
1. Test cache hit/miss behavior
2. Verify cache expiration works correctly
3. Test manual invalidation functionality
4. Benchmark performance improvement with caching
5. Verify cache size management
6. Test cache warming effectiveness

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Caching Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze application requirements and select appropriate caching strategies (e.g., cache-aside, write-through, write-aside) for both in-memory and Redis environments.
### Details:
Consider data access patterns, consistency needs, and performance goals. Document chosen strategies for each use case.

## 2. Set Up In-Memory Cache [pending]
### Dependencies: 38.1
### Description: Implement an in-memory cache layer within the application for fast, local data retrieval.
### Details:
Choose a suitable in-memory caching library or framework. Configure cache size, eviction policy, and integration points.

## 3. Set Up Redis Cache [pending]
### Dependencies: 38.1
### Description: Deploy and configure a Redis instance as a distributed cache for scalable, shared caching.
### Details:
Provision Redis, configure connection settings, and ensure network security. Integrate Redis with the application.

## 4. Design Key Generation Scheme [pending]
### Dependencies: 38.2, 38.3
### Description: Develop a consistent and collision-resistant key generation mechanism for both in-memory and Redis caches.
### Details:
Define key naming conventions, include relevant identifiers, and ensure compatibility across environments.

## 5. Implement Expiration Policies [pending]
### Dependencies: 38.4
### Description: Configure expiration (TTL) for cached items to balance freshness and resource usage.
### Details:
Set appropriate TTLs based on data volatility and access patterns. Support per-key or per-type expiration as needed.

## 6. Develop Invalidation Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 38.5
### Description: Implement cache invalidation logic to ensure data consistency after updates or deletions.
### Details:
Support manual and automated invalidation triggers. Handle both targeted and bulk invalidation scenarios.

## 7. Track Cache Hits and Misses [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Instrument the cache layers to record hit/miss statistics for monitoring and optimization.
### Details:
Log and expose metrics for cache performance analysis. Integrate with monitoring tools if required.

## 8. Implement Cache Warming Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and execute cache warming strategies to pre-populate the cache with frequently accessed or critical data.
### Details:
Identify hot keys and automate their loading during startup or predictable high-traffic events.

## 9. Manage Cache Size and Eviction [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Monitor and control cache size to prevent resource exhaustion and maintain performance.
### Details:
Configure eviction policies (e.g., LRU, LFU), set memory limits, and handle cache avalanches or stampedes.
