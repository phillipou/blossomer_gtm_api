# API Design Best Practices for AI Integration

Reference: https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/api-design-best-practices-for-ai-integration-889f9c08dde0

## Principles
- Clear endpoint purpose and use case
- RESTful, intuitive endpoint naming and versioning
- Strict input validation and descriptive error messages
- Optimized for performance and scalability
- Support for batch processing (where relevant)
- Stateless design for easy scaling
- Security: HTTPS, authentication, rate limiting
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Ethical and privacy considerations
- Model retrainability and future extensibility
- Cross-platform integration readiness

## Endpoint Design Checklist
- [ ] Clear, documented purpose
- [ ] RESTful path and method
- [ ] Input validation (Pydantic models)
- [ ] Descriptive error handling
- [ ] Fast, stateless response
- [ ] Security considerations
- [ ] Logging/monitoring hooks
- [ ] Documented in OpenAPI/Swagger
- [ ] Privacy/ethics reviewed

**All new endpoints should be reviewed against this rule.**
