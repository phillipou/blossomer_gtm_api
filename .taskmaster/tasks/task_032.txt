# Task ID: 32
# Title: Implement Complete Campaign Package Endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 29, 30, 31
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the /campaigns/complete endpoint to generate all campaign assets in a single request.
# Details:
1. Create FastAPI endpoint for /campaigns/complete
2. Implement request validation using Pydantic
3. Orchestrate calls to individual campaign generation services:
   - Positioning canvas generation
   - Email campaign pack generation
   - Enrichment blueprint generation
4. Optimize processing for parallel execution where possible
5. Structure combined JSON response format
6. Maintain individual asset structure within response
7. Add error handling for partial failures
8. Create caching mechanism for repeated requests
9. Implement response streaming for long-running operations

# Test Strategy:
1. Test endpoint with various website inputs
2. Verify response structure matches schema
3. Test with both user-provided and inferred ICPs
4. Benchmark endpoint performance against individual requests
5. Verify error handling for partial failures
6. Test streaming response functionality
7. Validate overall response quality and consistency

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and document clear, RESTful API endpoints that reflect the required resources and actions, ensuring intuitive structure and versioning.
### Details:
Endpoints should use nouns for resources and HTTP methods for actions. Include versioning in the URL or headers for backward compatibility.

## 2. Implement Request Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.1
### Description: Develop validation logic to ensure incoming requests conform to expected formats, types, and business rules before processing.
### Details:
Validate parameters, payloads, and headers to prevent invalid data from reaching downstream services.

## 3. Orchestrate Sub-Service Calls [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.2
### Description: Design orchestration logic to coordinate calls to multiple sub-services, managing dependencies and data flow between them.
### Details:
Ensure loose coupling and high cohesion among services, and avoid direct data or code sharing between microservices.

## 4. Enable Parallel Execution [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.3
### Description: Implement mechanisms to execute independent sub-service calls in parallel to optimize performance and reduce latency.
### Details:
Identify which service calls can be parallelized and manage their execution and result aggregation.

## 5. Format API Response [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.4
### Description: Aggregate and format the results from sub-services into a unified, client-friendly API response structure.
### Details:
Ensure consistency, clarity, and completeness in the response format, following API best practices.

## 6. Implement Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.3
### Description: Develop robust error handling to capture, log, and respond to failures in sub-services or orchestration, providing meaningful feedback to clients.
### Details:
Isolate failures, prevent cascading errors, and return standardized error responses with appropriate status codes.

## 7. Integrate Caching Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.5
### Description: Add caching layers where appropriate to store and quickly retrieve frequently accessed or computationally expensive data.
### Details:
Determine cacheable endpoints and data, and implement cache invalidation strategies to maintain data consistency.

## 8. Support Streaming Responses [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.5
### Description: Implement streaming capabilities for endpoints that deliver large or real-time data, enabling clients to process data as it arrives.
### Details:
Use appropriate protocols and formats (e.g., Server-Sent Events, WebSockets, chunked HTTP) for streaming.

## 9. Test and Validate End-to-End Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.6, 32.7, 32.8
### Description: Develop and execute comprehensive tests to validate endpoint behavior, orchestration logic, parallel execution, error handling, caching, and streaming.
### Details:
Use mocking and integration tests to ensure reliability, performance, and correctness under various scenarios.
