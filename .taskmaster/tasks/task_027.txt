# Task ID: 27
# Title: Implement Vector Database Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21, 24
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up ChromaDB integration for vector storage and retrieval-augmented generation.
# Details:
1. Initialize ChromaDB client and connection
2. Create collections for different content types
3. Implement embedding generation for website content
4. Create vector storage and retrieval functions
5. Implement semantic search capabilities
6. Add document chunking for large content
7. Create indexing optimization
8. Implement retrieval-augmented generation patterns
9. Add persistence configuration
10. Create backup and recovery procedures

# Test Strategy:
1. Test embedding generation for various content types
2. Verify semantic search accuracy
3. Benchmark vector operations performance
4. Test persistence across application restarts
5. Verify chunking works correctly for large documents
6. Test retrieval-augmented generation quality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install ChromaDB and Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the ChromaDB environment by installing the required packages and dependencies.
### Details:
Use pip to install ChromaDB and any necessary libraries for embedding generation (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace). Verify installation by importing ChromaDB in a Python shell.

## 2. Initialize ChromaDB Client [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.1
### Description: Create and configure a ChromaDB client for database operations.
### Details:
Decide between in-memory, persistent, or HTTP client modes. For persistence, specify the storage path. Initialize the client accordingly.

## 3. Create and Manage Collections [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.2
### Description: Set up collections to organize embeddings, documents, and metadata.
### Details:
Create collections with meaningful names. Implement functions to list, update, and delete collections as needed.

## 4. Implement Data Chunking Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.3
### Description: Design and apply a chunking method to split large documents into manageable pieces for embedding.
### Details:
Choose chunk size and overlap parameters. Ensure chunks preserve semantic coherence for effective retrieval.

## 5. Generate Embeddings for Chunks [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.4
### Description: Convert text or other data chunks into vector embeddings using a suitable model.
### Details:
Integrate with an embedding model (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace). Generate embeddings for each chunk and prepare them for storage.

## 6. Store Embeddings and Metadata [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.5
### Description: Add generated embeddings, original chunks, and metadata to the appropriate ChromaDB collection.
### Details:
Use ChromaDB's API to upsert embeddings, assign unique IDs, and attach relevant metadata for each chunk.

## 7. Index and Optimize Collections [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure collections are properly indexed for efficient semantic search and retrieval.
### Details:
Leverage ChromaDB's built-in indexing. Tune parameters for optimal search performance based on data size and query patterns.

## 8. Implement Semantic Search Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enable semantic search over stored embeddings to retrieve relevant chunks/documents.
### Details:
Develop query interfaces that accept user queries, generate query embeddings, and retrieve top-k similar chunks using ChromaDB.

## 9. Integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Combine semantic retrieval with generative models to implement RAG workflows.
### Details:
Fetch relevant chunks via semantic search and feed them into a generative model to produce context-aware responses.

## 10. Set Up Persistence and Backup Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure data durability and disaster recovery by configuring persistence and regular backups.
### Details:
Configure ChromaDB for persistent storage. Implement automated backup routines and test data restoration procedures.
